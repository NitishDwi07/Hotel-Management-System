The Hotel Management System project, implemented in Core Java with Java AWT and Swing for
the user interface, coupled with MySQL for database management, efficiently handles hotel
operations. It seamlessly manages reservations, room assignments, guest check-ins/outs,
and billing.
The Java components ensure a robust, platform-independent application, while MySQL stores
and retrieves data securely. This integrated system optimizes hotel management processes,
offering a user-friendly interface and reliable data storage for streamlined and effective
hospitality services.
